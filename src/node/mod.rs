//! Core tree data structures for phylogenetic trees.
//!
//! This module provides two tree representations:
//! - `Node`: Recursive tree with Box-based children (heap-allocated)
//! - `FlatTree`/`FlatNode`: Vector-based tree with index references
//!
//! Both representations support traversal (pre-order, in-order, post-order)
//! and can be converted between each other.
