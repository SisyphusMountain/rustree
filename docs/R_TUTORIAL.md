## Prerequisites

### Required
- **R** 4.0 or higher
- **Rust** 1.70 or higher (for building from source)
- **Cargo** (comes with Rust)

### Optional
- **thirdkind** for SVG visualization:
  ```bash
  cargo install thirdkind
  ```
- **ggplot2** for enhanced plotting (recommended):

---

## Installation

### Build from Source

**Important:** Build with R feature only to avoid symbol conflicts:

```bash
cd /path/to/rustree

# Build with R feature only (exclude Python)
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features r
```

The compiled library will be at:
- Linux: `target/release/librustree.so`
- macOS: `target/release/librustree.dylib`
- Windows: `target/release/rustree.dll`

### Load in R

```r
# Load the library (adjust path as needed)
dyn.load("target/release/librustree.so")  # Linux
# dyn.load("target/release/librustree.dylib")  # macOS

# Source the wrapper functions
source("R/rustree.R")
```

### Verify Installation

```r
# Simulate a small tree to test
sp_tree <- simulate_species_tree(10L, 1.0, 0.3, seed = 42L)
cat("Success! Tree has", tree_num_leaves(sp_tree), "leaves\n")
```

---

## Quick Start

```r
# Load library
dyn.load("target/release/librustree.so")
source("R/rustree.R")

# Simulate a species tree with 50 extant species
sp_tree <- simulate_species_tree(50L, 1.0, 0.3, seed = 42L)
cat("Species:", tree_num_leaves(sp_tree), "\n")

# Simulate 10 gene families with DTL events
gene_trees <- simulate_dtl_batch(
  sp_tree, 10L,
  lambda_d = 0.5,  # Duplication rate
  lambda_t = 0.2,  # Transfer rate
  lambda_l = 0.3,  # Loss rate
  seed = 123L
)

# Analyze the first gene family
gt <- gene_trees[[1]]
cat("Extant genes:", gene_tree_num_extant(gt), "\n")
cat("Events:", table(gt$event), "\n")

# Export results
save_newick(sp_tree, "/tmp/species.nwk")
save_xml(gt, "/tmp/gene_family_001.xml")
```

## Core Concepts

### Species Trees

Species trees represent the evolutionary history of species through speciation and extinction events. In rustree, species trees are simulated using a **birth-death process** or parsed from Newick format.

**Key operations:**
- `tree_num_leaves()` - Count extant species
- `tree_num_nodes()` - Count all nodes (including extinct lineages)
- `tree_height()` - Time from present to root (MRCA)
- `tree_leaf_names()` - List of species names

### Gene Trees and Reconciliation

Gene trees evolve along species trees but can experience additional events:
- **Duplication (D)**: Gene copies within the same species
- **Transfer (T)**: Horizontal gene transfer between contemporary species
- **Loss (L)**: Gene lineage goes extinct
- **Speciation (S)**: Gene follows the species tree split

Each gene tree node is **reconciled** (mapped) to a species tree node, recording which species hosted that gene.

### DTL Events

DTL events occur stochastically along species tree branches. Two simulation models are available:

1. **Per-gene-copy model** (standard): Event rate ∝ number of gene copies
2. **Per-species model** (Zombi-style): Event rate ∝ number of alive species

See [DTL Gene Tree Simulation](#dtl-gene-tree-simulation) for details.

---

## Simulation

### Birth-Death Species Trees

Simulate species trees with specified speciation (λ) and extinction (μ) rates:

```r
# Simulate tree with 100 extant species
sp_tree <- simulate_species_tree(
  n = 100L,        # Number of extant species (use L for integer)
  lambda = 1.0,    # Speciation (birth) rate
  mu = 0.5,        # Extinction (death) rate (must be < lambda)
  seed = 42L       # Random seed for reproducibility (optional)
)

# Inspect the tree
cat("Extant species:", tree_num_leaves(sp_tree), "\n")
cat("Total nodes:", length(sp_tree$name), "\n")
cat("Tree height:", max(sp_tree$depth), "\n")
cat("Species names:", paste(tree_leaf_names(sp_tree)[1:5], collapse = ", "), "...\n")
```

**Note on extinction rate:** The condition μ < λ ensures net diversification. If μ ≥ λ, the lineage would eventually go extinct.

**R-specific note:** All integer arguments **must** use the `L` suffix (e.g., `50L` not `50`).

### Parsing Newick Trees

Parse existing Newick-format trees:

```r
# Parse from string
newick_str <- "((A:1.0,B:1.0):1.0,(C:0.5,D:0.5):1.5):0;"
sp_tree <- parse_newick(newick_str)

# Or read from file
newick_str <- readLines("/tmp/species_tree.nwk")
sp_tree <- parse_newick(newick_str)

cat("Parsed", tree_num_leaves(sp_tree), "species\n")
```

### DTL Gene Tree Simulation

#### Single Gene Tree

```r
# Simulate one gene family
gene_tree <- simulate_dtl(
  species_tree = sp_tree,
  lambda_d = 0.5,    # Duplication rate
  lambda_t = 0.2,    # Transfer rate
  lambda_l = 0.3,    # Loss rate
  seed = 123L        # Optional seed
)

# Inspect results
cat("Extant genes:", gene_tree_num_extant(gene_tree), "\n")
cat("Events:\n")
print(table(gene_tree$event))
```

#### Batch Simulation (Recommended)

For multiple gene families, use `simulate_dtl_batch()` which is much more efficient:

```r
# Simulate 100 gene families
gene_trees <- simulate_dtl_batch(
  species_tree = sp_tree,
  n = 100L,          # Number of gene families
  lambda_d = 0.5,
  lambda_t = 0.2,
  lambda_l = 0.3,
  seed = 123L
)

# Analyze all families
extant_counts <- sapply(gene_trees, gene_tree_num_extant)
cat("Mean extant genes:", mean(extant_counts), "\n")
cat("Range:", min(extant_counts), "-", max(extant_counts), "\n")
```

**Performance note:** Batch simulation pre-computes shared data structures, providing significant speedup (~2-3x) compared to looping `simulate_dtl()`.

### Per-Gene-Copy vs Per-Species Models

#### Per-Gene-Copy Model (Standard)

The standard DTL model uses event rates proportional to the number of **gene copies** alive at any time. More gene copies → higher total event rate.

```r
# Standard model: event rate scales with gene copy count
gene_tree <- simulate_dtl(
  species_tree = sp_tree,
  lambda_d = 0.5,  # Rate per gene copy per unit time
  lambda_t = 0.2,
  lambda_l = 0.3,
  seed = 123L
)
```

**Characteristics:**
- Duplications increase the total event rate (more copies → more events)
- Can produce large gene families through runaway duplication
- Total event rate at time t: `(λ_d + λ_t + λ_l) × n_gene_copies(t)`

#### Per-Species Model (Zombi-Style)

The per-species model uses event rates proportional to the number of **alive species**, regardless of gene copy count. When an event fires, a random species is chosen; if it has no gene copies, the event fails silently.

```r
# Per-species model: event rate scales with species count
gene_tree <- simulate_dtl_per_species(
  species_tree = sp_tree,
  lambda_d = 0.5,  # Rate per species per unit time
  lambda_t = 0.2,
  lambda_l = 0.3,
  seed = 123L
)

# Batch version (more efficient)
gene_trees <- simulate_dtl_per_species_batch(
  species_tree = sp_tree,
  n = 100L,
  lambda_d = 0.5,
  lambda_t = 0.2,
  lambda_l = 0.3,
  seed = 123L
)
```

**Characteristics:**
- Duplications do NOT increase the total event rate
- Produces smaller gene families on average
- Total event rate at time t: `(λ_d + λ_t + λ_l) × n_alive_species(t)`

#### Comparing Models

```r
sp_tree <- simulate_species_tree(50L, 1.0, 0.3, seed = 42L)

# Per-copy model
gt_copy <- simulate_dtl(sp_tree, 0.5, 0.2, 0.3, seed = 1L)

# Per-species model
gt_species <- simulate_dtl_per_species(sp_tree, 0.5, 0.2, 0.3, seed = 1L)

cat("Per-copy model:\n")
cat("  Events:", paste(names(table(gt_copy$event)), table(gt_copy$event), sep = "=", collapse = ", "), "\n")
cat("  Extant:", gene_tree_num_extant(gt_copy), "\n\n")

cat("Per-species model:\n")
cat("  Events:", paste(names(table(gt_species$event)), table(gt_species$event), sep = "=", collapse = ", "), "\n")
cat("  Extant:", gene_tree_num_extant(gt_species), "\n")

# Per-species model typically shows fewer events and smaller families
```

### Assortative Transfers

By default, transfer recipients are chosen uniformly at random from contemporary species. **Assortative transfers** model distance-dependent transfer where closer species are more likely to exchange genes.

```r
# Distance-dependent transfers
# P(recipient) ∝ exp(-alpha × distance)
gene_tree <- simulate_dtl(
  species_tree = sp_tree,
  lambda_d = 0.5,
  lambda_t = 0.5,
  lambda_l = 0.3,
  transfer_alpha = 1.0,  # Distance decay parameter
  seed = 123L
)

# Batch with assortative transfers
gene_trees <- simulate_dtl_batch(
  species_tree = sp_tree,
  n = 100L,
  lambda_d = 0.5,
  lambda_t = 0.5,
  lambda_l = 0.3,
  transfer_alpha = 2.0,  # Stronger local preference
  seed = 123L
)
```

**Distance calculation:**
```
distance(A, B, t) = 2 × (t - depth_of_LCA(A, B))
```

**Parameter guidelines:**
- `transfer_alpha = NULL` or `0`: Uniform random (no distance preference)
- `transfer_alpha = 1.0`: Moderate local preference
- `transfer_alpha = 2.0`: Strong local preference
- `transfer_alpha = 5.0`: Very strong local preference (rare long-distance transfers)

**Works with both models:**
```r
# Assortative transfers with per-species model
gene_tree <- simulate_dtl_per_species(
  species_tree = sp_tree,
  lambda_d = 0.5,
  lambda_t = 0.5,
  lambda_l = 0.3,
  transfer_alpha = 1.5,
  seed = 123L
)
```

## Analysis

### Birth-Death Events

Species trees simulated with `simulate_species_tree()` include birth-death event data:

```r
# Simulate species tree
sp_tree <- simulate_species_tree(50L, 1.0, 0.5, seed = 42L)

# Access birth-death events
events <- sp_tree$events
cat("Event count:", nrow(as.data.frame(events)), "\n")

# Save to CSV
save_bd_events_csv(sp_tree, "/tmp/bd_events.csv")

# Analyze with R
df <- read.csv("/tmp/bd_events.csv")
print(table(df$event_type))
```

**CSV columns:**
- `time`: When the event occurred (backwards from present at 0)
- `node_id`: Node index where event occurred
- `event_type`: "Speciation", "Extinction", or "Leaf"
- `child1`, `child2`: Child node indices (for speciation events)

### Pairwise Distances

Calculate distances between nodes for phylogenetic analysis:

```r
# Metric distance (sum of branch lengths)
metric_dists <- pairwise_distances(
  sp_tree,
  distance_type = "metric",
  leaves_only = TRUE
)

# View results
print(head(metric_dists))

# Topological distance (edge count)
topo_dists <- pairwise_distances(
  sp_tree,
  distance_type = "topological",
  leaves_only = TRUE
)

# Save to CSV
save_pairwise_distances_csv(
  sp_tree,
  "/tmp/distances.csv",
  distance_type = "metric",
  leaves_only = TRUE
)
```

**Distance types:**
- `"metric"`, `"patristic"`, or `"branch"`: Sum of branch lengths (numeric)
- `"topological"` or `"topo"`: Number of edges (integer)

**Scope:**
- `leaves_only = TRUE`: Only leaf-to-leaf distances (extant species/genes)
- `leaves_only = FALSE`: All pairwise distances including internal nodes

### Subtree Extraction

Extract induced subtrees containing only specified taxa:

```r
# Get all species
all_species <- tree_leaf_names(sp_tree)

# Select subset
selected_species <- all_species[1:10]

# Extract induced subtree
subtree <- extract_induced_subtree_by_names(sp_tree, selected_species)
cat("Original:", tree_num_leaves(sp_tree), "leaves\n")
cat("Subtree:", tree_num_leaves(subtree), "leaves\n")

# Also works with gene trees
gene_tree <- simulate_dtl(sp_tree, 0.5, 0.2, 0.3, seed = 123L)
gene_names <- tree_leaf_names(gene_tree)[1:20]
sampled_gt <- extract_induced_subtree_by_names(gene_tree, gene_names)
```

### Species Leaf Sampling

`sample_leaves()` samples a subset of species from the species tree and automatically filters the gene tree to keep only genes mapping to the sampled species. Reconciliation mappings are preserved using an LCA-based approach.

```r
# Simulate
sp_tree <- simulate_species_tree(50L, 1.0, 0.3, seed = 42L)
gene_tree <- simulate_dtl(sp_tree, 0.5, 0.2, 0.3, seed = 123L)

# Keep only a subset of species
selected <- tree_leaf_names(sp_tree)[1:10]
sampled_gt <- sample_leaves(gene_tree, selected)

cat("Original extant:", gene_tree_num_extant(gene_tree), "\n")
cat("After sampling:", gene_tree_num_extant(sampled_gt), "\n")
```

### Parsing RecPhyloXML

Import reconciled gene trees from RecPhyloXML files (e.g., output from ALERax):

```r
# Parse a RecPhyloXML file
gene_tree <- parse_recphyloxml("/path/to/reconciled_tree.xml")

# Inspect the result
cat("Extant genes:", gene_tree_num_extant(gene_tree), "\n")
cat("Events:", paste(names(table(gene_tree$event)), table(gene_tree$event), sep = "=", collapse = ", "), "\n")

# Round-trip: export a gene tree and re-import it
save_xml(gene_tree, "/tmp/exported.xml")
reimported <- parse_recphyloxml("/tmp/exported.xml")
```

### Streaming Simulation (Memory-Efficient)

For large-scale simulations where holding all gene trees in memory is impractical, streaming functions write each tree directly to disk as it is generated. Only one tree is in memory at a time.

**Key difference from batch functions:** Streaming functions take a **Newick string** as input (not a tree list), and write files to an output directory instead of returning R objects.

#### Streaming to RecPhyloXML

```r
# Get the species tree as a Newick string
sp_tree <- simulate_species_tree(50L, 1.0, 0.3, seed = 42L)
newick <- tree_to_newick(sp_tree)

# Stream 1000 gene trees to XML files (per-gene-copy model)
simulate_dtl_stream_xml(
  newick, 1000L,
  lambda_d = 0.5, lambda_t = 0.2, lambda_l = 0.3,
  seed = 123L,
  output_dir = "/tmp/gene_trees_xml"
)
# Creates: /tmp/gene_trees_xml/gene_0000.xml, gene_0001.xml, ...

# Per-species (Zombi) model
simulate_dtl_per_species_stream_xml(
  newick, 1000L,
  lambda_d = 0.5, lambda_t = 0.2, lambda_l = 0.3,
  seed = 123L,
  output_dir = "/tmp/gene_trees_per_species_xml"
)
```

#### Streaming to Newick

```r
# Stream to Newick files (no reconciliation info preserved)
simulate_dtl_stream_newick(
  newick, 1000L,
  lambda_d = 0.5, lambda_t = 0.2, lambda_l = 0.3,
  seed = 123L,
  output_dir = "/tmp/gene_trees_nwk"
)
# Creates: /tmp/gene_trees_nwk/gene_0000.nwk, gene_0001.nwk, ...

# Per-species model to Newick
simulate_dtl_per_species_stream_newick(
  newick, 1000L,
  lambda_d = 0.5, lambda_t = 0.2, lambda_l = 0.3,
  seed = 123L,
  output_dir = "/tmp/gene_trees_per_species_nwk"
)
```

#### Optional Parameters

All streaming functions also support:
- `transfer_alpha`: Distance decay for assortative transfers (`NULL` = uniform)
- `replacement_transfer`: Probability of replacement transfer (`NULL` = no replacement)
- `require_extant`: If `TRUE`, retry until each tree has at least 1 extant gene

```r
simulate_dtl_stream_xml(
  newick, 500L,
  lambda_d = 0.5, lambda_t = 0.3, lambda_l = 0.3,
  transfer_alpha = 1.5,
  replacement_transfer = 0.1,
  require_extant = TRUE,
  seed = 42L,
  output_dir = "/tmp/assortative_xml"
)
```

### Induced Transfers

Use `induced_transfers()` to project/infer transfer events onto a sampled species subset.

```r
# DTL events are attached on simulated gene trees
dtl_events <- get_dtl_events(gene_tree)

# Species subset to keep
sampled_species <- tree_leaf_names(sp_tree)[1:20]

# 1) Projection mode (default): one projected row per transfer event
ind_proj <- induced_transfers(
  sp_tree,
  sampled_species,
  dtl_events,
  mode = "projection"
)

# 2) Damien-style mode
ind_damien <- induced_transfers(
  sp_tree,
  sampled_species,
  dtl_events,
  mode = "damien",
  remove_undetectable = FALSE
)

# Optional Damien filtering (equivalent to removeUndetectable=TRUE)
ind_damien_filtered <- induced_transfers(
  sp_tree,
  sampled_species,
  dtl_events,
  mode = "damien",
  remove_undetectable = TRUE
)

cat("projection:", nrow(ind_proj), "rows\n")
cat("damien:", nrow(ind_damien), "rows\n")
cat("damien filtered:", nrow(ind_damien_filtered), "rows\n")
```

## Export and Visualization

### ape `phylo` Format

The R package `ape` represents both species trees and gene trees as S3
`phylo` objects. rustree can build those objects directly from its flat tree
lists in Rust, avoiding a slower `tree_to_newick()` / `ape::read.tree()` round trip.
The converter allocates the final R vectors and matrices for the ape object and
fills them directly, so there is no intermediate Newick string or R-side tree
walk.

```r
library(ape)

sp_phylo <- as_ape_phylo(sp_tree)
gt_phylo <- gene_tree_to_ape(gene_tree)
gt_many <- gene_trees_to_ape(gene_trees)

attr(sp_phylo, "order")
head(sp_phylo$edge)

# Fastest path when ape output is all you need:
sp_phylo2 <- simulate_species_tree_ape(50L, 1.0, 0.3, seed = 42L)
gt_phylo2 <- simulate_dtl_ape(sp_tree, 0.5, 0.2, 0.3, seed = 123L)
gt_many2 <- simulate_dtl_batch_ape(sp_tree, 100L, 0.5, 0.2, 0.3, seed = 123L)

plot(sp_phylo)
plot(gt_many[[1]])
```

`tree_to_ape()` and `gene_tree_to_ape()` are aliases for `as_ape_phylo()`.
`gene_trees_to_ape()` is an alias for `as_ape_multiPhylo()`.

The direct simulation helpers are the lowest-overhead route when the ape object
is the final result. Use the regular `simulate_dtl()` / `simulate_dtl_batch()`
functions instead if you need reconciliation metadata, DTL event tables, CSV, or
RecPhyloXML export.

#### Translation Rules

rustree R trees are flat lists with zero-based structural indices in `parent`,
`left_child`, `right_child`, and `root`. Do not convert those indices to
one-based R indices before calling `as_ape_phylo()`. The returned ape object uses
ape's standard one-based node identifiers:

| rustree data | ape field | Translation |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| Leaf nodes (`left_child` and `right_child` are `NA`) | `tip.label` | Tips are numbered `1..Ntip` in preorder leaf order. |
| Internal nodes | `Nnode`, `node.label` | Internal nodes are numbered `Ntip + 1 .. Ntip + Nnode`; the root is `Ntip + 1`. Non-empty internal names become `node.label` when `use_node_labels = TRUE`. |
| Parent/child links | `edge` | The two-column integer matrix stores `(parent_id, child_id)` using ape node IDs. |
| Child branch length | `edge.length` | Each edge length is the rustree `length` of the child node in the same row of `edge`. |
| Root branch length | `root.edge` | Included when `include_root_edge = TRUE` and the rustree root length is finite, including zero-length root edges. |
| Requested row order | `attr(phy, "order")` | `order = "cladewise"` is preorder; `order = "postorder"` also accepts ape's `"pruningwise"` alias. |

The converter validates that the tree is reachable from the root, parent and
child links are consistent, and every node is either a leaf or binary internal
node. Missing `depth` values are derived from parent links and branch lengths.

Gene-tree conversion preserves the structural tree exactly, including loss
leaves. Call `sample_extant(gene_tree)` before conversion if an extant-only ape
tree is needed:

```r
gt_extant_phylo <- gene_tree_to_ape(sample_extant(gene_tree))
```

### Newick Format

```r
# Get as string
newick_str <- tree_to_newick(sp_tree)
cat(substr(newick_str, 1, 100), "...\n")  # First 100 characters

# Save to file
save_newick(sp_tree, "/tmp/species.nwk")
save_newick(gene_tree, "/tmp/gene_family.nwk")
```

### RecPhyloXML Format

RecPhyloXML is the standard format for reconciled gene trees:

```r
# Get as string
xml_str <- gene_tree_to_xml(gene_tree)

# Save to file
save_xml(gene_tree, "/tmp/gene_family.xml")

# Can be visualized with thirdkind or imported into other tools
```

### CSV Export

Export detailed node information including reconciliation mapping:

```r
# Save to file (returns invisibly)
save_csv(gene_tree, "/tmp/gene_family.csv")

# Read and analyze
df <- read.csv("/tmp/gene_family.csv")
print(head(df))

# CSV columns:
# - node_id: node index
# - name: node name
# - parent: parent node index (or NA for root)
# - left_child, right_child: child indices (or NA for leaves)
# - length: branch length
# - depth: depth from root
# - species_node: mapped species node name
# - event: event type (Speciation, Duplication, Transfer, Loss, Leaf)
```

### SVG Visualization

Generate publication-quality visualizations (requires `thirdkind`):

```r
# Generate and return as string
svg_content <- gene_tree_to_svg(gene_tree)

# Save to file
gene_tree_to_svg(gene_tree, "/tmp/gene_family.svg")

# Save and open in browser
gene_tree_to_svg(gene_tree, "/tmp/gene_family.svg", open_browser = TRUE)
```

**Installation requirement:**
```bash
cargo install thirdkind
```

- `"metric"`, `"patristic"`, `"branch"`: Sum of branch lengths
- `"topological"`, `"topo"`: Number of edges

#### Streaming Parameters
- `newick`: Species tree as a Newick string (character) — note: streaming functions take a string, not a tree list

## Data Structures

### Species Tree Structure

```r
sp_tree <- simulate_species_tree(10L, 1.0, 0.5, seed = 42L)

# Tree structure (flat representation)
sp_tree$name           # Character vector: node names
sp_tree$parent         # Integer vector: parent indices (NA for root)
sp_tree$left_child     # Integer vector: left child indices (NA for leaves)
sp_tree$right_child    # Integer vector: right child indices (NA for leaves)
sp_tree$length         # Numeric vector: branch lengths
sp_tree$depth          # Numeric vector: node depths from root
sp_tree$root           # Integer: index of root node

# Birth-death events
sp_tree$events$time         # Numeric vector: event times (backward from 0)
sp_tree$events$node_id      # Integer vector: node where event occurred
sp_tree$events$event_type   # Character vector: "Speciation", "Extinction", "Leaf"
sp_tree$events$child1       # Integer vector: first child index
sp_tree$events$child2       # Integer vector: second child index
```

### Gene Tree Structure

```r
gt <- simulate_dtl(sp_tree, 0.5, 0.2, 0.3, seed = 123L)

# Tree structure (same as species tree)
gt$name, gt$parent, gt$left_child, gt$right_child
gt$length, gt$depth, gt$root

# Reconciliation information
gt$species_node    # Character vector: mapped species node name
gt$event           # Character vector: event type

# The original species tree is embedded
gt$species_tree    # Nested list with species tree structure
```

### Working with Indices

The structural index columns in rustree lists are zero-based because they come
directly from Rust. Add 1 when using them to index R vectors manually:

```r
# Access node by index (R uses 1-based)
node_idx <- 5
node_name <- sp_tree$name[node_idx]
parent_idx <- sp_tree$parent[node_idx]

# Navigate the tree
if (!is.na(parent_idx)) {
  parent_name <- sp_tree$name[parent_idx + 1L]
  cat("Node", node_name, "has parent", parent_name, "\n")
}

# Get children
left_idx <- sp_tree$left_child[node_idx]
right_idx <- sp_tree$right_child[node_idx]

if (!is.na(left_idx)) {
  left_name <- sp_tree$name[left_idx + 1L]
  right_name <- sp_tree$name[right_idx + 1L]
  cat("Node", node_name, "has children", left_name, "and", right_name, "\n")
}
```

## Comparison to Python Bindings

The R bindings provide similar functionality to the Python bindings but with R-specific conventions:

| Feature | Python | R |
|---------|--------|---|
| **Integer literals** | `50` | `50L` (must use `L` suffix) |
| **Missing values** | `None` | `NULL` |
| **List indexing** | `gene_trees[0]` (0-based) | `gene_trees[[1]]` (1-based) |
| **Method calls** | `sp_tree.num_leaves()` | `tree_num_leaves(sp_tree)` |
| **DataFrame** | Returns pandas DataFrame | Returns data.frame |
| **Visualization** | `display()` for Jupyter | Standard R plotting |

### Example Comparison

**Python:**
```python
import rustree
sp_tree = rustree.simulate_species_tree(50, 1.0, 0.3, seed=42)
gene_trees = sp_tree.simulate_dtl_batch(100, 0.5, 0.2, 0.3, seed=123)
gt = gene_trees[0]
print(gt.num_extant())
```

**R:**
```r
dyn.load("target/release/librustree.so")
source("R/rustree.R")
sp_tree <- simulate_species_tree(50L, 1.0, 0.3, seed = 42L)
gene_trees <- simulate_dtl_batch(sp_tree, 100L, 0.5, 0.2, 0.3, seed = 123L)
gt <- gene_trees[[1]]
cat(gene_tree_num_extant(gt), "\n")
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Library not loaded error**

```r
Error in dyn.load("target/release/librustree.so"): ...
```

Solution: Check path and ensure built with `--features r`:
```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features r
```

**2. Integer/numeric type errors**

```r
Error: argument must be integer
```

Solution: Use `L` suffix for integers:
```r
# Wrong:
simulate_species_tree(50, 1.0, 0.3)

# Correct:
simulate_species_tree(50L, 1.0, 0.3)
```

**3. thirdkind not found**

```r
Error: thirdkind binary not found
```

Solution: Install thirdkind:
```bash
cargo install thirdkind
```

**4. Simulation hangs**

Possible causes:
- Very large trees (>1000 species) with high DTL rates
- High loss rate with `require_extant = TRUE` (many retries)

Solutions:
- Reduce tree size or DTL rates
- Use batch simulation (more efficient)
- Remove `require_extant = TRUE`

**5. Symbol conflicts when loading both Python and R**

Error: Undefined symbols or crashes

Solution: Build separately with only the needed feature:
```bash
# For R only:
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features r

# For Python only:
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features python
```
